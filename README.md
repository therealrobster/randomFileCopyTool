# randomFileCopyTool
Copies files randomly from a specific source folder to a destination folder within a total size limit

This tool was designed as I have a digital photo frame that I like to put new photos onto from time to time.
Selecting 16GB of photos manually is extremely time consuming so this tool allows me to:
- Select a file type (JPG in my example)
- Select a source folder
- Select a destination folder
- Select the maximum size of all files to copy (16GB in my example)

It chooses random files and copes them across.

It can be used with any filetype though, so is flexible to be used in other situations where you need a random selection of files that need to be copied.

Tested with Python3 on Linux and OSX.  Not tested on Windows.
Run with "python3 photoFrameFiller.py" from the command line.
